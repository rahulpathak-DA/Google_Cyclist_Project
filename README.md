# Google_Cyclist_Project
Google capstone project in Data analytics Course

####

Introduction
This undertaking is a component of the Google Data Analytics course, focusing on a case study analyzing the bike-share operations of a Chicago-based company named Cyclist. The clientele is divided into two categories: casual riders, who opt for single-ride or full-day passes, and Cyclist members, who subscribe to annual memberships. The objective is to discern the distinctions between casual riders and members and formulate market strategies aimed at converting casual riders into paying annual members.

Following recommendations was drawn from the investigation. 

1. #Weekend Customer Focus#: The majority of our customer base is active on weekends, presenting an opportunity for targeted efforts. Consider developing a special package or plan that provides exclusive benefits for weekday bike usage. Alternatively, introduce enticing rewards for subscribers specifically tailored to their weekend activities.

2. #Peak Hour Utilization#: Noteworthy bike usage occurs during peak hours, particularly during the typical office commute between 9 AM and 6 PM. Direct marketing efforts towards this demographic to optimize engagement and potentially encourage more subscriptions.

3.#Addressing Gender Disparity#:Although we lack explicit gender data, extrapolating from subscriber information suggests a gender gap in usage. To bridge this gap, consider implementing special schemes or promotions targeting female users, thereby promoting inclusivity and encouraging broader participation.

4.#Seasonal Usage Patterns#:Seasonal variations in bike usage, potentially influenced by weather conditions such as snow, highlight the need for strategic planning. Launching special packages tailored to peak seasons, especially during the July-September period, could attract more users and enhance overall engagement.

5.#Age-Driven Marketing#:Analyzing usage data reveals age-related variations, with a peak around 30 years and a subsequent decline. Design customized marketing plans catering to different age groups, including teenagers, young adults, middle-aged individuals, seniors, and retirees, to effectively address their unique needs and preferences.

6.#Strategic Station Placement#:Identify stations with substantial footfall, such as destination stations with IDs 192 and 91, to strategically place advertising materials. Consider offering special packages for frequently chosen routes, and assess the need for increased docking capacity at high-traffic stations to enhance user experience.

7.#Usage Duration Segmentation#:Understanding that most customers utilize bikes for durations under 20 minutes, create a nuanced marketing strategy by categorizing usage into duration buckets (e.g., up to 20 mins, 20 mins to 1 hour, over 1 hour). Tailor promotions to each category to maximize user satisfaction and encourage extended usage.

8.#Targeting High-Milestone, Low-Footfall Areas#: Despite numerous milestones, some locations experience lower footfall. Direct targeted efforts towards these areas to increase awareness and engagement. Explore strategies to attract more users to these specific locations, ensuring a more balanced and widespread utilization of our services.
