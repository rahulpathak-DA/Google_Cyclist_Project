# Google_Cyclist_Project
Google capstone project in Data analytics Course

####

Introduction
This undertaking is a component of the Google Data Analytics course, focusing on a case study analyzing the bike-share operations of a Chicago-based company named Cyclist. The clientele is divided into two categories: casual riders, who opt for single-ride or full-day passes, and Cyclist members, who subscribe to annual memberships. The objective is to discern the distinctions between casual riders and members and formulate market strategies aimed at converting casual riders into paying annual members.
